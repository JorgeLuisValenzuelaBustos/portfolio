            Hello! I'm Jorge Luis Valenuzela Bustos, and I'm so glad you're here. Whether you stumbled upon this page by chance or intentionally sought it out, I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.
            I've always had a knack for problem-solving and a love for coding, which led me to pursue web development as a career. Over the years, I've gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and other modern technologies.
            <br/>
            Feel free to browse my portfolio or get in touch if you have a project in mind. I'd love to help bring your web ideas to life!
